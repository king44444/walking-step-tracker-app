# Lifetime Award Image Enhancement - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Enhanced the lifetime step count award generator to create visually stunning, personalized award images based on user interests and milestone achievements.

## Implementation Date
October 9, 2025

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Enhancement
- **Migration**: `database/migrations/20251009203400_add_interests.php`
- **Added Column**: `interests` (TEXT, nullable) to the `users` table
- **Storage Format**: Comma-separated interests (e.g., "mountains, guitars, astronomy, dogs")

### 2. Enhanced Prompt Builder
- **Location**: `api/lib/ai_images.php`
- **New Function**: `build_lifetime_award_prompt()`
- **Features**:
  - **Random Interest Selection**: Randomly picks ONE interest from comma-separated list
  - Personalized prompts based on selected interest
  - Milestone-specific style hints:
    - **100k-199k**: Gold medal motif, radiant gradients, joyful sparks
    - **200k-499k**: Platinum glow, aurora sky, elegant symmetry
    - **500k+**: Cosmic energy, nebula background, mythic feel
  - Fallback to generic artistic theme if no interests specified
  - Requests 1024x1024 high-quality images
  - Emphasizes "digital painting + vector hybrid" style

### 3. Scope Filter Logic
- **Location**: `api/lib/ai_images.php` - `ai_image_generate()` function
- **Detection Logic**:
  ```php
  $isLifetime = (stripos($kind, 'lifetime') !== false) || ($milestone >= 100000);
  ```
- Routes lifetime awards (100k+ steps) to enhanced prompt
- All other awards continue using simple prompt

### 4. User Data Integration
- **Location**: `api/award_generate.php`
- **Changes**:
  - Modified SQL query to fetch `interests` column
  - Pass complete user object to `ai_image_generate()`
  - User data includes: id, name, interests

### 5. Enhanced SVG Fallback
- **Location**: `api/lib/ai_images.php` - `ai_image_svg_badge()` function
- **Milestone-Specific Color Schemes**:
  - **500k+**: Cosmic purple-blue gradient (#1a0a3e → #2a1a5e)
  - **200k+**: Platinum silver-blue (#0a1a2a → #1a2a4a)
  - **100k+**: Warm gold tones (#1a1408 → #2a2418)
  - **< 100k**: Default dark blue (#0b1020 → #111936)

## Example Prompt Generated

For a user named "Mike" with interests "mountains, photography, astronomy" reaching 200,000 steps:

```
Design a breathtaking digital award image celebrating a lifetime walking achievement. 
Mike has reached 200,000 lifetime steps (Quarter Million). 
Create a highly detailed, imaginative emblem that visually represents their personality 
and interests: mountains, photography, astronomy. 
Use luminous color, depth, and storytelling elements. 
Capture the feeling of epic accomplishment, motion, and personal triumph. 
Composition: centered emblem, cinematic lighting, subtle text 'Lifetime 200,000 Steps'. 
No faces or photo realism. Square 1024x1024 ratio. 
Style: digital painting + vector hybrid, vivid and collectible. 
Style hint: platinum glow, aurora sky, elegant symmetry.
```

## Testing Results

All tests passed successfully:
- ✓ 100,000 steps milestone with interests
- ✓ 200,000 steps milestone with interests  
- ✓ 500,000 steps milestone with interests
- ✓ 150,000 steps milestone without interests (fallback theme)

Generated images located in: `site/assets/awards/{user_id}/`

## Files Modified

1. `database/migrations/20251009203400_add_interests.php` - NEW
2. `api/lib/ai_images.php` - Enhanced with new prompt builder and SVG styling
3. `api/award_generate.php` - Updated to fetch and pass user interests
4. `test_lifetime_awards.php` - NEW test script

## How to Use

### Setting User Interests

Update user interests via database:
```sql
UPDATE users SET interests = 'hiking, cooking, music' WHERE id = 1;
```

### Generating Lifetime Awards

The system automatically detects lifetime awards (100k+ steps) and applies enhanced prompts when:
1. Award kind contains "lifetime", OR
2. Milestone value >= 100,000

### Manual Generation via API

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost/api/award_generate.php \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-CSRF: {token}" \
  -d '{
    "user_id": 7,
    "kind": "lifetime_steps",
    "milestone_value": 200000,
    "force": true
  }'
```

## AI Provider Integration

The system supports OpenRouter AI image generation when configured:
- Set `ai.image.provider` to "openrouter"
- Set `ai.image.model` (e.g., "google/gemini-2.5-flash-image")
- Configure `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` in `.env`

Falls back to enhanced SVG badges when AI is unavailable or disabled.

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. Admin UI for managing user interests
2. User profile page where users can set their own interests
3. More milestone tiers (750k, 1M, 2M, etc.)
4. Seasonal/themed variations
5. Achievement galleries showcasing all earned awards

## Notes

- SVG fallbacks now have milestone-specific color schemes
- All awards maintain visual consistency while feeling unique
- System gracefully handles missing interests data
- Backwards compatible with existing award system
